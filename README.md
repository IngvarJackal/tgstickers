# tgstickers
It's a telegram bot for custom stickers tags.

The main idea is to write own custom descriptions for telegram stickers and to use them via inline mode like ```@cnambot joy``` and it will show you stickers which you marked as "joy"

## Features
* Inline mode
* Word stemmatization for selected languages (if selected)
* Fuzzy search (if selected)
* Global search (if selected)
